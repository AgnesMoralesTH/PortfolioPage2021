            <h2>About Rodolfo:</h2>
            <span>
                Hello there! My name is Rodolfo and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer.

I started my journey as a self-taught web developer right out of High School when I first discovered the biggest CMS in the industry, WordPress. Ever since I have fallen in love with web development and spend most of my days taking my craft to the next level.

Nowadays I tend to code all of my projects from scratch in order to deliver a unique experience to every company.

Like many other people, I enjoy spending my free time increasing my knowledge of Web Development and building new and challenging projects.
